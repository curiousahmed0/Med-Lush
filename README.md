(Date January 2023 ) MedLush is my third semester final project of data structures and algorithms course. It is an mini console based c++ medical app which uses avl tree data structure . This app contains point of sale and also admin panel. Modules that it contains are patient record , product , users and cash manipulation etc. As this is an dsa project so it also contains a module of " DSA Stuff " which shows visual depiction of stored Avl data trees on a 2d format.
